    "Random Forest is a supervised machine learning algorithm which is based on ensemble learning. In this kernel, I build two Random Forest Classifier models to predict the safety of the car, one with 10 decision-trees and another one with 100 decision-trees. The expected accuracy increases with number of decision-trees in the model. I have demonstrated the **feature selection process** using the Random Forest model to find only the important features, rebuild the model using these features and see its effect on accuracy. \n"

    "Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm. It has two variations – one is used for classification problems and other is used for regression problems.

It is also a pretty good indicator of feature importance.\n",
